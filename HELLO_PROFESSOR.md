# Computer-Project-2-Neutron-Balance-
Contains code, input, and output files for Andrew Liu's Computer Project 2

To avoid formatting errors when copying/ugly appearance, here is a github repository of my code, input, and output files. My code is able to read any (as long as my computer doesn't explode, which it will at a certain point) number of discrete neutron energy group data for infinite space, as long as the format follows the format detailed in my input/output files. 

Enjoy! (I hope)
